# travel-search-autocomplete

Imagine you own an aircraft charter broker business.
Your customers contact you for a trip availability from an origin (airport) to a
destination (airport) on a certain date, you then send them the available options to
choose, book and travel from.

🧑‍🎨 Made the whole design by myself.

🤖 Trip Card data could seem a little bit weird, because API doesn't work as expected, it's almost impossible to get a normal trip data.

ℹ️ Used REDUX just to represent my skills, but in this case it will be better if we use Context API.

⭐️ Created my own ICONS "library", so you can move your svg icon into the Icons folder, and reuse it with a specific styles.

🚀 To run the project on LOCAL server, run following commands:

```
npm install
```

```
npm start
```

Hope you enjoy it!
